# Model Overview

### Description:
SOMA (Unifying Parametric Human Body Models) is a unified framework that decouples identity representation from pose parameterization by mapping any supported parametric body model to a single canonical mesh topology and skeleton, enabling a shared Linear Blend Skinning (LBS) pipeline across all backends. SOMA supports six identity backends (SOMA-shape, SMPL, SMPL-X, MHR, ANNY, and GarmentMeasurements), unified under a canonical mesh topology and SOMA skeleton. 

This model is ready for commercial use. 

### License/Terms of Use:
SOMA is released under the [Apache 2.0 License](../../LICENSE).

### Deployment Geography:
Global

### Use Case:
SOMA is intended for use by computer vision researchers, graphics and animation engineers, machine learning engineers, and robotics researchers and companies. Specific use cases include:
- **Pose estimation and human reconstruction** — unified pose interface enables seamless identity substitution across backends without retraining.
- **Motion generation and animation** — apply motion capture sequences to any supported identity model using the same axis-angle pose parameterization.
- **Avatar synthesis and digital humans** — freely mix identity sources with SOMA's pose representation.
- **Simulation and robotics** — lightweight analytical forward pass enables real-time simulation pipelines with diverse body shapes.

### Expected Release Date:
GitHub: 03/16/2026 <br>

## Model Architecture:
**Architecture Type:** Analytical / Parametric; optional shallow Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for pose-dependent surface correctives <br>

**Network Architecture:** The core pipeline uses no learned neural network components. It is composed of three closed-form analytical modules:
1. **Barycentric Mesh Transfer** — sparse barycentric correspondence matrix pre-computed per backend; runtime topology transfer is a single sparse matrix-vector product in O(V_h) time.
2. **RBF Skeleton Fitting** — Radial Basis Function regression with Kabsch rotation alignment yields the 77-joint identity-adapted skeleton transforms in a single linear solve per identity.
3. **Linear Blend Skinning (LBS)** — standard LBS with joint-orient (T-pose-relative) parameterization; GPU-accelerated via NVIDIA Warp custom kernels with `torch.export`-compatible interface.

Optional: shallow pose-dependent corrective MLP (2 hidden layers, ReLU activations) for surface artifact reduction. <br>

**This model was developed independently by NVIDIA.** <br>

**Number of model parameters:**
- Core analytical pipeline: 0 learned parameters (closed-form)
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for SOMA-shape model: 128 principal components × ~18,000 vertices × 3 = ~3.1 × 10⁶ coefficients (pre-fitted, not gradient-trained)
- Optional pose corrective Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) layers: ~1 × 10^8 parameters (if enabled)

## Computational Load
**Throughput:** > 7,033 posed meshes/second on NVIDIA A100 80GB (batch size 128, GPU Warp path) <br>
**Latency:** 2.1 ms per mesh (batch = 1, GPU); 12.1 ms (batch = 1, CPU 32-core) <br>
**Skeleton fitting:** < 1.68 ms (batch = 1) <br>
**Training compute:** N/A — core pipeline requires no gradient-based training; PCA shape space fitted offline from body scan data.

## Input(s):
**Input Type(s):** Numerical tensors (floating-point) <br>

**Input Format(s):**
- Identity coefficients: floating-point tensor, shape `(B, K)` where `K = 128` for SOMA-shape backend or backend-specific dimensionality for SMPL/SMPL-X/MHR/ANNY/Garment
- Pose parameters: axis-angle vectors `(B, 77, 3)` or rotation matrices `(B, 77, 3, 3)` covering 77 articulated joints (excludes root dummy joint)
- Optional root translation: `(B, 3)` in meters

**Input Parameters:** One-Dimensional (1D) coefficient vectors; Three-Dimensional (3D) pose tensors <br>

**Other Properties Related to Input:**
- Identity coefficients should lie within the shape space of the respective backend (no hard clipping, but extreme out-of-distribution values may produce artifact geometry).
- Pose parameters follow standard axis-angle convention; no clamping is applied.
- All inputs are standard float32 PyTorch tensors. No pre-processing beyond normalization within each backend's identity model is required.

## Output(s):
**Output Type(s):** Numerical tensors (3D geometry) <br>

**Output Format(s):** PyTorch float32 tensors <br>

**Output Parameters:** Three-Dimensional (3D) <br>

- Posed mesh vertices: `(B, N_h, 3)` where `N_h ≈ 18,095` — world-space vertex positions in **meters**
- Joint positions: `(B, 77, 3)` — world-space 3D joint positions in **meters**
- Rest-shape vertices: `(B, N_h, 3)` in meters (intermediate output, available on request)

**Other Properties Related to Output:** All outputs are in meters. Vertex count `N_h` is fixed by the SOMA canonical topology (mid-resolution LOD, approximately 18,095 vertices). Joint count is fixed at 77.
